Your task is to reimplement Word2Vec algorithm, train the model on WikiText-103 or WikiText-2, and visualize the word embeddings using t-SNE. To make the visualization readable, you should not visualize all the words, about 100 words are enough for demonstration purposes.

Your submission is a Jupyter notebook file with the t-SNE visualization (I will not re-run your notebook to create the visualization).
